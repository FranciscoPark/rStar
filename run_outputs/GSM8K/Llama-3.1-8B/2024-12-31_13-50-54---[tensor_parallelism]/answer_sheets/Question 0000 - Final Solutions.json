To do this, we can subtract the eggs used for meals from the original amount (16). From condition 1, we know that Janet lays 16 eggs each day.

Condition 3 tells us that Janet earns $2 per egg sold. We calculate this as follows:\n\nnumber of eggs sold (9) times price ($2) equals $18\n\nThis is Janet's daily income.
