First of all, we know that Josh spent $50,000 on repairs. And we also know that these repairs increased the value of his house by 150%. Let's calculate the increase in value of the house first. We can do it by multiplying the cost of the repairs by the percentage increase in value. Since the repair costs Josh $50,000, we just need to multiply this amount by 150%. 150% means 150/100 or 1.5. Thus, our calculation looks like this: $50,000 x 1.5. This gives us $75,000 as the increase in value. Next, let's convert the 150% into a decimal. Remember that we divide by 100 since percentages are expressed as a fraction out of 100. Dividing 150 by 100 gives us 1.5. Now, let's find the new value of the house by adding the original value to the increase in value we calculated earlier. We already know that the original value of the house was $80,000, so let's add that to the increase in value, which is $75,000. This gives us $155,000. Finally, we can calculate the profit made by simply subtracting the original cost of the house from the new value of the house. The original cost of the house was $80,000, so we subtract this from the new value, which is $155,000. That leaves us with $75,000.
