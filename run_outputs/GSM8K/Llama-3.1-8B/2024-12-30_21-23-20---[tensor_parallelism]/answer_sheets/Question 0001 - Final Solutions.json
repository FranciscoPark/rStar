Since there are 2 bolts of blue fiber needed to craft one robe, let's create a variable called b that represents the amount of blue fiber we need to use. b = 2. Next, move on to condition 2: Half as much white fiber is required compared to blue fiber. We can write this as w/b = 0.5. Where w stands for the amount of white fiber we need to use. Solve for w and you'll get w = 0.5b. Substitute b = 2 into the equation, which will give us w = 1. The reason why we used w/b instead of w=0.5b is because it shows us a comparison between white fiber and blue fiber. Using the same unit of measurement will help us see clearly whether there is enough fiber or not.

To find out how many bolts of fiber are necessary to craft one robe, first let's work backwards. Suppose one bolt of blue fiber was used up to make a robe.

Then according to Condition 2, half as much white fiber would also be needed to make the same robe, which would be 0.5 bolts of white fiber.
