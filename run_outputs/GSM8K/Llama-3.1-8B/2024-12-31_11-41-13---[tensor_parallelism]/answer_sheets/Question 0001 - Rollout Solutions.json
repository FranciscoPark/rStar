First, we need to know how much white fiber it takes to make one robe. Since we know that it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we divide that by 2 to find out how much white fiber it would take. Half of 2 is 1. This means we need 1 bolt of white fiber for every 2 bolts of blue fiber. Next, we want to know how many bolts of all types combined it takes to make one robe. We double the result from step 1 because we need two bolts, 1 bolt of blue fiber, and 1 bolt of white fiber for every robe. 2 times 1 is 2, so we need 2 bolts combined for every robe. Finally, we multiply this result by 10 since we want to know how many robes can be made with 10 bolts of blue fiber and 10 bolts of white fiber. This gives us 2 multiplied by 10 which equals 20.
